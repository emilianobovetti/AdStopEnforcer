*AdStopEnforcer* is a web extension meant to prevent those boring messages like `Please disable your ad-blocker and refresh page to continue`.

The *mode selection* system allows to set one of the following:

-   Off: *AdStopEnforcer* is turned off.
-   Normal: Usual anti ad-blocker detection mode.
-   Experimental: A more powerful system can prevent many other sites to detect ad-blockers, but an higher risk to break some sites.

Every time mode is changed the page have to be refreshed to take effect.

Experimental mode is highly risky, use it carefully!

Please note this extension may cause problems on some websites, both in normal and experimental mode.

*AdStopEnforcer* is free and open source software and it's released under the [GPLv3](https://github.com/emilianobovetti/AdStopEnforcer/blob/master/LICENSE).
