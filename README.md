FuckFuckAdBlock
===============

*FuckFuckAdBlock* is a web extension meant to prevent those boring messages like `Please disable *AdBlock* and refresh page to continue`.

From version 0.4 mode selection allows to set one of the following:

![off](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3957026/16162724/805985fe-34d5-11e6-84cf-371567aef34b.jpg)
*FuckFuckAdBlock* is turned off.

![normal](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3957026/16162725/805c84de-34d5-11e6-9ce6-ba52a6efdb1e.jpg)
Usual anti AdBlock detection mode.

![experimental](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3957026/16162723/8053ef18-34d5-11e6-8653-81eddd029305.jpg)
A more powerful system can prevent on many other sites to detect AdBlock, but an higher risk to break some sites.

Every time mode is changed the page have to be refreshed to take effect.

Experimental mode is highly risky, use it carefully!

Please note this extension may cause problems on some websites, both in normal and experimental mode.
